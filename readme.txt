git repository for dycton project.

for git repository management best practices refer to https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices

that includes, among others: 
- Do read about git
- Do commit early and often
- Don't panic (ask questions)
- don't (never ever) rewrite public history
- Do make useful commit messages <--- PLEASE
- Do keep up to date
- (Almost) Always name your stashes
- don't commit anything that can be regenerated from other things that were committed. (but don't hesitate to ammend the .gitignore at repo root)
- "on saussage making" : master is clean, publish dirty in branches (and commit even dirtier)

For branch / subject management:
- one subject equal one branch, no exception.
- from the above master is only for publishing.
